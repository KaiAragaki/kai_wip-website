      <description>Introduction Like it or not, things are happening all the time. Even worse, you don&amp;rsquo;t know when a lot of these things will happen. Sure, you might have a general idea - kids learn to walk around the age of 1 or so, students tend to graduate after 4 years of undergraduate school, and dogs learn to shake after a certain number of treats and head scratches - but you don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly when these things happen.</description>

      <description>I was tired of looking up what various statistical tests do, so in hopes of remembering, I wanted to try the &amp;rsquo;learn by teaching&amp;rsquo; method. Worse comes to worst, I can just look back at this if need be.&#xA;That was five days ago. After five days of looking at poorly scanned PDFs of books published in the last millennium, formulae that look more like hexes than anything else, diving down into the C source code of R, and, of course, plenty of time on Wikipedia - I think I almost have a grip as to what&amp;rsquo;s going on.</description>
