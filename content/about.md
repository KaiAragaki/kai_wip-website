I'm Kai Aragaki. I'm currently a pharmacology PhD candidate at Johns Hopkins, on track to graduate in 2024. 

I have significant experience in both wet-lab and dry-lab techniques, and always delighted to learn more whenever possible. I have about 8 years of wet lab experience, and about 7 years of experience with R.

Some of the things I've gotten into over the years - 


Wet lab:
- Cell culture (2D and 3D), Western blotting, qPCR, DNA and RNA library preparation, invasion/migration assays, flow cytometry, molecular cloning...

Dry lab:
- Wrangling and tidying, package development, analysis (RNA, DNA sequencing), documentation (Rmd/qmd + pkg/book/blogdown), pipeline management (targets), app development (Shiny)...

When I'm not doing all that, I love taking photographs (both film and digital), fawning over my cat (Pep) and plants, swing dancing, or learning something new.
