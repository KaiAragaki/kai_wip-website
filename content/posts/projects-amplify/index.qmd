[amplify](https://kaiaragaki.github.io/amplify/index.html) provides a suite of functions to analyze routine ΔΔCt qPCR data away from the QuantStudio, with greater flexibility, by providing features such as:
- tidying data from off the QuantStudio
- Plate and expression plotting
- (Re)calculation of RQ
- Resetting of control probe

For more information, see [Analyzing ddCt qPCR with amplify](https://kaiaragaki.github.io/amplify/articles/analyzing-ddctqrtpcr.html)

Additionally, amplify automatically generates QC reports for routine standard-curve library-preparation quantification assays (see [Performing Library Quantification QC](https://kaiaragaki.github.io/amplify/articles/performing-lib-quant-qc.html)).

# plan-pcr

amplify is used by [plan-pcr](https://kai-a.shinyapps.io/plan-pcr/) ([source/README](https://github.com/KaiAragaki/plan-pcr)), a Shiny app used to help make plate layouts, calculate dilutions and amounts of mastermix needed, and generate reports.
