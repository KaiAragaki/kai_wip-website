gplate introduces a **g**rammar of **plate**s.

Microwell plates are usually arranged in visually meaningful ways but are not tidy data, and their manipulation to and from a tidy form is cumbersome. gplate is aimed at both developers that create packages that ingest and produce plate data as well as for interactive operating on microwell data.
